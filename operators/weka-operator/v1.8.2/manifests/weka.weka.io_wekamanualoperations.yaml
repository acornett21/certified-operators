                        description: "NodeName is a type that holds a api.Node's Name
                          identifier.\nBeing a type captures intent and helps make
                          sure that the node name\nis not confused with similar concepts
                          (the hostname, the cloud provider id,\nthe cloud provider
                          name etc)\n\nTo clarify the various types:\n\n  - Node.Name
                          is the Name field of the Node in the API.  This should be
                          stored in a NodeName.\n    Unfortunately, because Name is
                          part of ObjectMeta, we can't store it as a NodeName at the
                          API level.\n\n  - Hostname is the hostname of the local
                          machine (from uname -n).\n    However, some components allow
                          the user to pass in a --hostname-override flag,\n    which
                          will override this in most places. In the absence of anything
                          more meaningful,\n    kubelet will use Hostname as the Node.Name
                          when it creates the Node.\n\n* The cloudproviders have the
                          own names: GCE has InstanceName, AWS has InstanceId.\n\n\tFor
                          GCE, InstanceName is the Name of an Instance object in the
                          GCE API.  On GCE, Instance.Name becomes the\n\tHostname,
                          and thus it makes sense also to use it as the Node.Name.
                          \ But that is GCE specific, and it is up\n\tto the cloudprovider
                          how to do this mapping.\n\n\tFor AWS, the InstanceID is
                          not yet suitable for use as a Node.Name, so we actually
                          use the\n\tPrivateDnsName for the Node.Name.  And this is
                          _not_ always the same as the hostname: if\n\twe are using
                          a custom DHCP domain it won't be."

                          1. Run the following command to list all PCI devices on your system:
                             ```bash

                          2. Find the relevant PCI device in the output, which will display both the
                             vendor and device IDs in square brackets in the format [vendorId:deviceId].
