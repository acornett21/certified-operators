                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                        to topologies that satisfy it.
                        It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                        MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                        won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                  id,\nthe cloud provider name etc)\n\nTo clarify the various types:\n\n
                  \ - Node.Name is the Name field of the Node in the API.  This should
                  be stored in a NodeName.\n    Unfortunately, because Name is part
                  of ObjectMeta, we can't store it as a NodeName at the API level.\n\n
                  \ - Hostname is the hostname of the local machine (from uname -n).\n
                  \   However, some components allow the user to pass in a --hostname-override
                  flag,\n    which will override this in most places. In the absence
                  of anything more meaningful,\n    kubelet will use Hostname as the
                  Node.Name when it creates the Node.\n\n* The cloudproviders have
                  the own names: GCE has InstanceName, AWS has InstanceId.\n\n\tFor
                  GCE, InstanceName is the Name of an Instance object in the GCE API.
                  \ On GCE, Instance.Name becomes the\n\tHostname, and thus it makes
                  sense also to use it as the Node.Name.  But that is GCE specific,
                  and it is up\n\tto the cloudprovider how to do this mapping.\n\n\tFor
                  AWS, the InstanceID is not yet suitable for use as a Node.Name,
                  so we actually use the\n\tPrivateDnsName for the Node.Name.  And
                  this is _not_ always the same as the hostname: if\n\twe are using
                  a custom DHCP domain it won't be."
