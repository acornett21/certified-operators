                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the

                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                        Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                                MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector

                                for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.

                                MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.
                                It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key

                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket.
                            We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                            Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                            nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                            e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                            And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                            - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                              but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                              skew.
                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                            if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                            "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:

                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.
